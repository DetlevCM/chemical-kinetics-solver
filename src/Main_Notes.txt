 
The main source code file needs to be improved in terms of structure with 
clearer inputs and clear functionality selection.

The code should be updated to allow the following choices:

1) Run the solver - default chem.inp and initial.inp files

2) Run the solver specifying either file

3) Run the code to lump species for a reduced mechanism

4) other functionality?
