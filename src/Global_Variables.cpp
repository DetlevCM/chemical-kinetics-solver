/* It seems a limited number of global variables cannot be avoided.
 * The reaction scheme as well as species concentrations will need
 * to be provided as a global variable as the ODEs need access to
 * them without passing any variables to the relevant void
 *
 * By making the following global, I avoid vector re-declarations
 * This has a positive impact on performance by sticking them in a
 * namespace I make them more manageable.
 * It also allows me to size the array beforehand
